/// they took. The way this process works is that a snapshot of the game state
/// is stored (to capture any mutations that occurred *before* the animation),
/// and then the update is stored. During the animation process, the
/// stored snapshots and [GameUpdate]s are played back sequentially.

/// Many types of state changes are handled automatically by the game state
/// snapshot system, so appending an update is only needed for custom
/// animations. For example the system will correctly detect and animate a card
/// which has moved to a new position.
