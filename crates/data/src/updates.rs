/// Some game state changes in Spelldawn require custom animations in the UI in
/// order to communicate their effects clearly. In order to implement the
/// animation system, code which mutates game state can also call
/// [GameState::push_update] and provide a [GameUpdate] to record the action
/// they took. The way this process works is that a snapshot of the game state
/// is stored (to capture any mutations that occurred *before* the animation),
/// and then the update is stored. During the animation process, the
/// stored snapshots and [GameUpdate]s are played back sequentially.
///
/// Many types of state changes are handled automatically by the game state
/// snapshot system, so appending an update is only needed for custom
/// animations. For example the system will correctly detect and animate a card
/// which has moved to a new position.
